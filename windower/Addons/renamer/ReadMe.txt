  HOW TO USE THIS ADDON:

    First place the windower version of renamer in your \Addons\ directory.
    Now place a list file in \Addons\renamer\lists\ or Edit an exiting list.

      //lua load renamer
    This will load the addon, but in an inactive state.

      //renamer load filename
    This loads the list of objects to rename from the specified file and activates the addon.
    To change to a different list simply input the command again using anotehr file name.

  TO AUTO LOAD:
    Use the Windower plugin manager to edit your plugin autoload settings.

  OTHER COMMANDS:
      //renamer status
    Will display the currently loaded name list file, if any.

      //renamer stop
      //renamer unload
    Either of these will tell the addon to cease renaming objects.


  MORE TO BE ADDED AT A LATER DATE!
    Some future possibilities under consideration:
      Ability to add/remove lines from list file via addon commands.
      Pet renaming. "Atomic Squirrel" Instead of "Carbuncle".
      Conditional naming. "Proto-Ultima (Energy Screen)"
      A cleaner/neater/simpler list file format.
